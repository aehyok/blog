In a video released today, the Figure 01 bot is seen conversing in real-time.</p><p>The development progress at Figure is nothing short of extraordinary. Entrepreneur Brett Adcock only emerged from stealth last year, after gathering together a bunch of key players from Boston Dynamics, Tesla Google DeepMind and Archer Aviation to &quot;create the world&#39;s first commercially viable general purpose humanoid robot.&quot;</p><p>By October, the Figure 01 was already up on its feet and performing basic autonomous tasks. By the turn of the year, the robot had watch-and-learn capabilities, and was ready to enter the workforce at BMW by mid-January.</p><p>We got to see it on the warehouse floor last month, just before Figure announced a successful Series B funding round along with a collaboration agreement with OpenAI &quot;to develop next generation AI models for humanoid robots.&quot; Now we get a taste for what that means.</p><p>Adcock confirmed in an X post that Figure 01&#39;s integrated cameras send data to a large vision-language model trained by OpenAI, while Figure&#39;s own neural networks also &quot;take images in at 10 Hz through cameras on the robot.&quot; OpenAI is also responsible for the ability to understand spoken words, and all of this influx of information is translated into &quot;fast, low level, dexterous robot actions&quot; by Figure&#39;s neural net.</p><p>He confirmed that the robot was not teleoperated during the demo, and that the video was filmed at actual speed. All up, a remarkable achievement for a partnership that&#39;s less than two weeks old – &quot;our goal is to train a world model to operate humanoid robots at the billion-unit level,&quot; said Adcock. At this rate, we won&#39;t have to wait long.</p><p>Figure已展示了其与OpenAI合作增强人形机器人能力的第一个成果。在今天发布的一段视频中,可以看到Figure 01机器人实时对话。</p><p>Figure的发展进程无疑是非同寻常的。企业家布雷特·阿德科克仅在去年才从谨慎状态走出,之前他汇集了来自波士顿动力公司、特斯拉、谷歌DeepMind和Archer Aviation的关键人员,目的是&quot;创造世界上第一款商业化可行的通用人形机器人&quot;。</p><p>到10月,Figure 01已能独立站立并执行基本任务。转眼至年底,这个机器人就具备了观察学习能力,并于1月中旬准备在宝马公司投入工作。</p><p>上个月我们在仓库里见到了它,之后不久Figure就宣布成功完成B轮融资,并与OpenAI达成合作协议&quot;开发下一代人形机器人AI模型&quot;。现在我们终于一窥这意味着什么。</p><p>阿德科克在X网站上确认,Figure 01的集成摄像头将数据发送到由OpenAI训练的大型视觉语言模型,而Figure自己的神经网络也&quot;以10Hz频率通过机器人上的摄像头输入图像&quot;。OpenAI还负责理解口语能力,所有这些信息流被Figure的神经网络转化为&quot;快速、低级、灵活的机器人动作&quot;。</p><p>他证实,这个演示视频中的机器人没有遥控操作,并且视频是以实际速度拍摄的。总的来说,这是一个令人难以置信的成就,因为这个合作伙伴关系仅维持了不到两周的时间。阿德科克说:&quot;我们的目标是训练一个世界模型,使人形机器人能够百万单位运行。&quot;按照这个速度,我们不用等太久就能看到了。</p>",12)]))}const g=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{c as __pageData,g as default};
